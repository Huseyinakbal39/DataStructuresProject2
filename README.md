First things first my program reads a file filled with numbers.
Then it adds numbers to AVL-Trees line by line.
After adding whole line to the tree it adds to stack whether the number is a leaf or not too.
If the number is leaf of tree it adds to stack which is related with this tree.(If we are reading 4.line numbers will be added to 4.AVL tree and 4.Stack.)
After all this,program do a summation to number which is not leaf of tree.
We will see 500 letter printed according to this summation.
To our notation program delete the stack and the tree related.
We will see the program deleting letters by letter according our notation.
Last thing we will see is the last AVL tree number and which letter it has.
